# Comprehensive User Guide: Importing Deliveries

Welcome! This guide is designed to help you easily import your delivery data so you can start optimizing your routes quickly and efficiently. You don‚Äôt need to be a technical expert‚Äîwe‚Äôll break down every step, helping you successfully bring your delivery information into the server.

## 1. Friendly Introduction

You are about to learn **how to import deliveries into the server**. Importing your list of deliveries allows the system to analyze your data, ensure addresses are recognized (geocoded), and calculate the most efficient routes for your operations. By following these simple steps, you will quickly transform raw data into optimized delivery routes!

## 2. Getting Started Section

This section covers the initial preparation and navigation needed to begin the import process.

### Navigation and Preparation Steps

The process begins by navigating to the **Delivery Report**.

1.  **Go to Deliveries:** From the main menu, navigate to **Deliveries** [1, 2: 0:00‚Äì0:07].
2.  **Download Sample Data (Optional):** If you are unsure of the required format, you can tap on **download** to obtain an Excel file containing sample data [1, 2: 0:14‚Äì0:18].
    *   üí° **Tip:** Using the sample data template ensures your file is correctly formatted for a smooth import.

### Initial Configuration: Starting the Import

Once you have your delivery data ready, you can start the import process.

1.  **Tap to Import:** Tap on **import** to begin importing your delivery data [1, 2: 0:30‚Äì0:32, 1:00‚Äì1:02].

## 3. Feature Explanations with Benefits

The import process uses several key features designed to ensure your data is accurately prepared for route optimization.

### Data Mapping

When you import data, a **mapping window will appear** [2: 1:19‚Äì1:25]. This feature allows you to match the fields from your Excel file (like address or customer name) with the corresponding fields in the server [2: 1:19‚Äì1:25].

*   **Benefit:** **Ensures accuracy** so that the system correctly understands which data corresponds to addresses, customer identification, or stop names.

### Geocoding View

After you finish mapping and proceed, a Map View appears [3: 2:07‚Äì2:10]. This view uses colors to provide immediate feedback on the quality of your imported addresses (geocoding).

*   **Yellow Color** indicates that the delivery location has been successfully **geocoded at the sheet level** [3: 2:12‚Äì2:16]. This usually means the system recognized the address clearly.
*   **Gray Color** indicates that the delivery location is **not geocoded** [3: 2:17‚Äì2:20]. These are addresses the system could not recognize fully, and they may require adjustment.
*   **Benefit:** **Saves time** by visually highlighting addresses that need attention before you attempt route optimization.

### Route Optimization

The final step is initiating the optimization process. This feature calculates the best possible sequence of stops to reduce travel time and costs.

*   **Benefit:** Transforms static delivery lists into efficient, dynamic routes.

## 4. Common Tasks: Detailed Steps

This section details the critical steps for importing your data, focusing on how to match your delivery fields correctly.

### Task 1: Importing and Matching Data Fields

Follow these steps to upload your file and ensure your data columns are correctly matched to the server's requirements.

1.  **Initiate Import:** Tap on **import** to import your sample data [2: 1:00‚Äì1:02].
2.  **Access Mapping Window:** A mapping window will open, prompting you to match your file‚Äôs fields with the server‚Äôs fields [2: 1:19‚Äì1:25].

#### Example: Manually Mapping Customer ID and Name

If the system doesn't automatically recognize a field, you can manually set or correct the matching [1, 3: 1:30‚Äì1:32].


![GIF at 1:39‚Äì1:41](../../images/Import of deliveries_timestamp_1_to_39‚Äì1_to_41.gif "Tap on ignore ‚Äì Customer ID and Name are ignored.")


![GIF at 1:42‚Äì1:44](../../images/Import of deliveries_timestamp_1_to_42‚Äì1_to_44.gif "Tap show all ‚Äì All mapping options become visible.")


![GIF at 1:46‚Äì1:49](../../images/Import of deliveries_timestamp_1_to_46‚Äì1_to_49.gif "Tap the customer ID ‚Äì The field is matched to the server's Customer ID field.")


![GIF at 1:51‚Äì1:53](../../images/Import of deliveries_timestamp_1_to_51‚Äì1_to_53.gif "Tap the ignore under the name ‚Äì The Name field is ready for re-mapping.")


![GIF at 1:54‚Äì1:58](../../images/Import of deliveries_timestamp_1_to_54‚Äì1_to_58.gif "Tap on name ‚Äì The mapping was done.")

6.  **Proceed:** Tap on **next** to move to the Geocoding Map View [1, 3: 1:58‚Äì2:00].

### Task 2: Reviewing Geocoding and Starting Optimization

After successfully mapping your data, you can review the geocoding results and start planning your routes.

1.  **Review the Map View:** The Map View appears, displaying the geocoding results using different colors [3: 2:07‚Äì2:10].
    *   *Screenshot/Diagram Description:* Imagine a map where locations recognized accurately are marked **Yellow**, and locations not recognized are marked **Gray** [3: 2:12‚Äì2:20].

![GIF at 2:24‚Äì2:26](../../images/Import of deliveries_timestamp_2_to_24‚Äì2_to_26.gif "Tap on optimize my routes ‚Äì Optimization starts.")

    *   **Result:** Once you start the optimization, the system will begin calculating the best possible routes [3: 2:28‚Äì2:32].

## 5. Productivity Tips

Use these tips to make your import process faster and more reliable!

*   üí° **Prioritize Yellow:** If you see many locations marked **Yellow**, you know your geocoding is successful and you can proceed quickly to optimization [3: 2:12‚Äì2:16].
*   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Address Gray Locations:** If you see locations marked **Gray**, those addresses were not geocoded [3: 2:17‚Äì2:20]. You should try to review and correct the addresses in your spreadsheet before importing again, or the system will not be able to include them in the route optimization.
*   üí° **Quick Mapping:** If you are using a standard file structure (like the downloaded sample data), the mapping may already be done for you [2: 1:25‚Äì1:29]. Simply review the matches and tap **next** if they look correct.
