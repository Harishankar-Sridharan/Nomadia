# TourSolver User Guide: Creating Your Trial Account

Welcome to the TourSolver platform! We are excited to help you get started. This guide walks you through creating your account in the **TourSolver Test Environment** using simple, clear steps. Creating your account is quick and easy, building the foundation you need to start optimizing your routes.

***

## 1. Getting Started

### System Requirements & Limitations

Since you are setting up a trial account, there are a few things to note before you begin:

*   **Email Address:** You must have access to a valid email address to complete the verification process.
*   **Trial Account Limitations (⚠️ Warning):** Please note that the trial account comes with limitations. For example, you may be limited to **up to 250 visits per optimization**. If you need full access, you will need to switch to the production version later.
*   **Password Complexity:** Your chosen password must include:
    *   At least one uppercase letter.
    *   At least one lowercase letter.
    *   A number.
    *   A special character.

### The TourSolver Setup Flow

The account creation process involves three main stages:

1.  **Email Verification:** Confirming your email address using a one-time password (OTP).
2.  **Profile Creation:** Setting your name, country, and secure password.
3.  **Onboarding:** Providing essential company details (e.g., activity, number of vehicles).

## 3. Feature Explanation & Benefits

Your **TourSolver Trial Account** is now ready!

The primary benefit of the trial account is immediate access to the routing platform. You can immediately begin testing the optimization features, although you should be aware of the specific limitations, such as handling **up to 250 visits per optimization**. This allows you to explore the platform's capabilities before committing to the full production version.

## 4. Productivity Tips

Here are a few tips to ensure a smooth start and secure access:

*   💡 **Keep Your Password Secure:** Since your password must meet rigorous security standards (uppercase, lowercase, number, special character), consider using a password manager or writing it down safely until you are familiar with it.
*   💡 **Remember Trial Limitations:** If your testing requires complex routes with more than 250 stops, remember that you will need to switch to the **production version** to unlock full access and remove that limitation.
*   💡 **Use Company Activity Context:** When specifying your *Activity* during onboarding, be specific. This context helps the platform understand the nature of the routes you will be solving.
